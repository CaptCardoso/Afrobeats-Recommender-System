The popularity of afrobeats has increased tremendously as a result of social media. Everyday there seems to be a new tiktok challenge being created with the latest Afrobeats song.
Using Machine Learning, I have created a recommender system that will create an afrobeats playlist based on the songs in your spotify playlist.

This recommender system helps to guide new comers into the world of afrobeat.

I am attempting to create a recommendation system that will generate an Afrobeats playlist based on your favourite playlist.

## DATA

I am using the spotipy program to fetch the songs from the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) API.

The [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) API gives a lot of useful track features, such as danceability, acoustics etc. Explanations of the different features are done in the methodology below.
